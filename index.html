        <h1>The History of the Potato</h1>
        <p>
          Baked or fried, boiled or roasted, as chips or fries. At some point in your life, you've probably eaten a potato. It's delicious, for sure! However, potatoes have played much more a significant role in our history than just that of a
          dietary staple we have come to know and love today. Without the potato, our modern civilization might not exist at all.
        </p>

      <div id='Peru-slide'>
        <h3>8000 - 5000 BC: Potatoes first domesticated in Peru</h3>
        <div id="mapid"></div>
        <p>
          Containing high proteins and carbohydrates, as well as essential fats, vitamins,
          and minerals, potatoes were the perfect food source to fuel a large
          Incan working class as they built and farmed their terraced fields,
          mined the rocky mountains, and created the sophisticated civilization
          of the great Incan empire.

      <div id='Europe-slide'>
        <h3>1536: Potatoes travel to Europe</h3>
        <p>
          But considering how vital they were to the Incan people, when Spanish sailors
          returning from the Andes first brought potatoes to Europe, the spuds were duds.
          Europeans simply didn't want to eat what they considered dull and tasteless
          oddities from a strange new land, too closely related to the deadly
          nightshade plant, Belladonna, for comfort. Instead of consuming them,
          they used potatoes as decorative garden plants. More than 200 years would
          pass before the potato caught on as a major food source in Europe. Though even
          then, it was predominantly eaten by the lower classes.

      <div id='population-slide'>
        <h3>1750s: Sprouting empires</h3>
        <p>
          European peasants with greater food security no
          longer found themselves at the mercy of the regularly occuring grain
          famines of the time, and so their populations steadily grew.
          As a result, the British, Dutch, and German empires rose on the backs of the
          growing groups of farmers, laborers, and soldiers, thus lifting the
          West to its place of world dominian.

      <div id='irish-slide'>
        <h3>1845-1852: Irish Potato Famine</h3>
        <p>
          However, not all European countries
          sprouted empires. After the Irish adopted the potato, their population
          dramatically increased, as did their dependence on the potato as a major
          food source. Then, disaster struck. From 1845 to 1852, the potato blight
          disease ravaged the majority of Irish potato crop, leading to the Irish
          Potato Famine. Over a million Irish citizens starved to death, and 2 million more left their
          homes behind.

      <div id='ind-rev-slide'>
        <h3>1850s: Industrial Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          This wasn't the end for the potato. The crop eventually
          recovered, and Europe's population, especially the working classes,
          continued to increase. Aided by the influx of Irish migrants, Europe
          now had a large, sustainable, and well-fed population that was capable
          of manning the emerging factories that would bring about our modern world
          via the Industrial Revoluation.
